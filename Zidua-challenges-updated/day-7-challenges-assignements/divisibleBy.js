// Write a program that takes a positive integer n as input and outputs the sum of all numbers between 1 and n that are divisible by 3 or 5 (or both).
// For example, if n is 15, the program should output 45, since the numbers between 1 and 15 that are divisible by 3 or 5 are: 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10, and their sum is 45.


// let num = 16;


//     if(num % 3 ===0){
//         console.log(`The number is divisible by 3 is:  ${num}`);
//     }
//     else{
//         console.log(`Not divisible by 3 ${num} is `)
//     }
let numbers = [1,3,4,5,6]
console.log(numbers[numbers.length-1])


// let sum = 0
// for (i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
//     if (i % 2 == 0) {
//         sum = sum + i;
//     }
// }
// console.log(sum);
