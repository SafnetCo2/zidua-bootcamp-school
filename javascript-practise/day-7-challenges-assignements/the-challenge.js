// Cosing Challenge(LOOPS):
// Sum of numbers between 1 and ‘n’
// Write a program that takes a positive integer n as input and outputs the sum of all numbers between 1 and n that are divisible by 3 or 5 (or both).
// For example, if n is 15, the program should output 45, since the numbers between 1 and 15 that are divisible by 3 or 5 are: 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10, and their sum is 45.
// Here are some additional requirements and hints:
// 1. Use a loop to iterate over all the numbers between 1 and n.
// 2. Use an if statement and the modulus operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 3 or 5.
// 3. Use a variable to keep track of the running sum, and update it on each iteration of the loop.
// 4. You can assume that the input n will be a positive integer.

// 1. sum of numbers between 1 and 'n'
// use for loop which is used to repeat a block of codes for specific number of times.
//1 Write a prproogram that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
