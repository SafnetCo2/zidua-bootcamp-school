//Quiz
// Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle
// The program should:

// – Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle.
// – Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the length and width entered by the user.

"use strict";
const prompt = require("prompt-sync")({sigint: true});// require loads the program with the function prompt
//signit terminates the program in the terminal after it has been excuted
let length = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the length of a rectangle: ")); 
let  width = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the width of a rectangle:  "));
let area   = length*width;
let perimeter = 2*(length+width);
console.log(`The area ${area} and perimeter  ${perimeter} of rectangle  `);

// Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle
// The program should:
// – Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle.
// – Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the length and width entered by the user.

// Cosing Challenge 2:
// Sum of numbers between 1 and ‘n’
// Write a program that takes a positive integer n as input and outputs the sum of all numbers between 1 and n that are divisible by 3 or 5 (or both).
// For example, if n is 15, the program should output 45, since the numbers between 1 and 15 that are divisible by 3 or 5 are: 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10, and their sum is 45.
// Here are some additional requirements and hints:
// 1. Use a loop to iterate over all the numbers between 1 and n.
// 2. Use an if statement and the modulus operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 3 or 5.
// 3. Use a variable to keep track of the running sum, and update it on each iteration of the loop.
// 4. You can assume that the input n will be a positive integer.
// Good luck!
